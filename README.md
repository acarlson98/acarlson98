## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer from Nebraska with experience in both low-level embedded software and high-level website development. I've recently been working in mostly C++/Qt, especially front-end work in QML and JavaScript.

Currently open to remote roles and roles based in Southern Florida!
